"#identifier of the model: the first number indicate the variant consumption's reaction search, this is followed by the identifier of the target, finally, the last number indicates the variant for production's reaction search","#criteria used to compare the model variants between each other. Default ones are fluxk thorught the exchange reaction of the substrate (minimized), production rate fo the target (maximized), number of reactions knock ins (minimized), MDF value (maximised), length of the pathway (minimized)",#user selected weights for each criteria as assigned undr the column 'weight' in the input file,"#normalized scores for each criteria. Each normalized score ranges from 0 to 1, with 1 indicating the best among the model variants",#final score of each model. Derived by multiplying the normed scores by the weight of theri criteria. The final scores ranges from 0 to 1. Scores closer to 1 indicate the most favourable engineering strategies according to the computational metabolic analysis,#percentage indicating the number of biobricks found per number of reactions knock ins suggested,#number of reaction knock outs allowed per optknock analysis round,#BiGG reactions identifiers for the knock outs found with optknock analysis.,#objective value resulting from running FBA on the model when the knock-outs are applied. The objective of this optimization is the production rate of the target
