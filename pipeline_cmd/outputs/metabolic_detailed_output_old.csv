"#identifier of the model, in which the first number indicate the variant consumption's reaction search, followed by the identifier of the target. The last numver indicate the variant for production's reaction search",#flux through the exchange reactions of the carbon source. Unit = mmol/gDW/h. Negative values indicate uptake,#flux throught the exchange reaction of the targetUnit = mmol/gDW/h. Positive values indicate production.,"#MDF value. Unit = kJ/mol. The higer the MDF value, the higher the thermodynamic driving force",#number of reactions steps from substrate to product. The lower the better,#identifiers of the BiGG reactions found with gapfilling. They represent the reactions knock ins (KIs) suggested to reach growth on the selected c-source and production of the target,#fluxes through the reactions KIs. Unit = mmol/gDW/h ,#EC number of the reactions KIs,#KEGG reactions IDs of the KIs,#identifier of the Biobrick that carries gene(s) encoding for enzyme(s) whose functions matches the reactions KIs,#coding sequence in fasta format of the gene(s) included in the biobrick part with the matching function/reaction,#species name of the organis from which the gene has been cloned,"#codon harmonized gene sequence. The sequence provided in 'Biobrick sequence' column is codon ahrmonized and it is free from restriction sites used in biobrick assembly (EcoRI, SpeI, XbaI, PstI)","#native codon harminizaition index (CHI) - codon harmonized and restriction site free CHI. The closer to 0 the difference is, the best the codon harmonization with the native frequences is"
