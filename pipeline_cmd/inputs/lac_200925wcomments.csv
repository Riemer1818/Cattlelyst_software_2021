The formulas won't be saved in the .csv format but the data will. It is also advisable to delete the comments'line before using the csv file for the analysis. 
#BiGG identifier of the metabolites without compartment specification. One carbon source and one product should be included. Other compounds of interest could be added too.,"#indicate if a compound is to be considered as carbon source. If equals No, no, NO, N or n the compound is not a carbon source. One compoud should always be indicated as carbon sourse by typing yes, Yes, Y, y or YES",#indicate with yes or no if the compound has to be take up or not. A negative value can also be used to specify the maximum uptake rate of the carbon source during production of the target.,#indicate with yes or no if the compound has to be produced. ,#The users have to indicate which compound is used as preferred carbon source of the reference organism. The BiGG identifier without compartment indication should be used,#a negative value indicating the uptake rate of the preferred substrate. This negative value will be used to constrain the biomass equation when doinf FBA with biomass as model objective,#reaction BiGG ID for the reactions that the user expects to be present. It is usggested to always include trasnport reactions for all metabolites to assure their correct location in the model compartment. Exchange reactions and transport reactions are default added to the reference model if not already present. The other reactions are added to the universal model if not present yet.,#arbitrary reaction name,#optional specification of the reaction subsystem (e.g. pathways). Mainly useful for the user.,"#reaction equation with all metabolites in BiGG ID including the compartment indications (_e, _p, _c). Allowed arrows are -->, <--, <=>. This reactions equations will be read as strings and the build_reaction_from_string function of cobrapy package.",#lower bound of the reaction,#upper bound of the reaction,#optional information of gene protein association,#KEGG reaction identifier,#Enzymme Commission number of the reactions,"#The universal model that the pipeline should consider ase reactions database should be specified in this column. Accepted entries are bacteria, grampos (for Gram-positive specific model), gramneg (for Gram-negative specific model), cyanobacteria, archaea.","#positive integer indicating the number of times Gapfilling algorythm should be run on the same model. After each iteration a penalty is given to already used reactions, leading to higer chance of resulting in different solutions.","#criteria to compare the model on. Intervention, mdf and path_length should be kept invariated. Criteria on uptake rate and production rate should be written as consumption_ and production_ following by the identifier of substrate and target compounds respectively. The identifierd should be written as indicated in column A.","#positive integers indicating the importance of each criteria relatively to the final score. The higer the number, the higher the weight for the criteria will be. The number in this column are normed in column T.",#automatically calculated: normed weigths of each criteria. The values of column S are divided by their sum (U3) resulting in numbers between 0 and 1. Those are the weight used for each criteria.,#automatically calculated sum of user-indicated rough weights of each criteria,"#automatically calculate total number of the criteria. For user information, not used in any calculation",#automatically calculated sum of normed weights. Used just as check sicne it is always equal to 1. ,"#indicate if the metabolism of the reference organism is aerobic by writing yes, Yes, Y, y or YES. This information will be used in the preparation of the model for thermodynamic analysis.",#balanced equation of the reaction. This information is not used by the pipeline but we believe it helps defining the aim of the design. This information will be included in the summary_output.csv file,"#number indicating the (negative) stoichiometric coefficient of the substrate. It is used to set the bounds of the exchange reaction of the substrate when pFBA analysis is done. The lower bound is calculated as 1.1*Z3, while the upper bound is obtained from the following product 0.9*Z3.",#number indicating the positive stoichiometric coefficient of the target product. It is set to be the lower bound fo the exchange reactions of the target compound when pFBA is run.,#numbers indicating the minimal and maximal concentrations of the substrate in mM. The phisiological default one are 0.001 and 10 mM.,#name of the .gz compressed fasta file the multi-sequence CDS of the reference organism (expression host). It should be located in pipeline/inputs directory,"#indicate if the pipeline should also consider reactions knock-outs in the design strategies. If it is filled with yes, Yes, Y, y or YES Optknock algorithm is used, whereas it it is filled with No, no, NO, N or n the algorithm is not used. ",#BiGG identifier of the reference model.
