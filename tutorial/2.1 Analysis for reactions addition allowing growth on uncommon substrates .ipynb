    "# Analysis for reactions addition allowing growth on uncommon substrates \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the models have been loaded and prepared (*see Tutorial 1*) the analysis can be performed. The pipeline first conisders if the model is able to grow on the user-indicated carbon source and if not it looks for which reactions from the universal model could be added to the model of the chassis organism in order to confer that function to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This first search of reactions allowing growth on an uncommon substrate is done with the function *analysis_gf_sol*. This function sets the right constraint in the model of the chassis and then calls the COBRApy[1] function for [gapfilling analysis](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gapfilling.html). In particular, *analysis_gf_sol* sets the upper bound of the biomass reactions to the normal growth rate in the wild type chassis. Thus, any reaction addition that is identified with gap-filling leads to a growth rate that is maximally equal to the wild type. (The objective of the optimization is the biomass reaction)\n",
    "\n",
    "The function *dict_prod_sol* is used to evaluate if the addition of the reactions indicated by the gapfilling analysis makes the chassis' model also able to produce a target product indicate by the user. If the model can't already simulate production the function *dict_prod_sol* calls again the COBRApy[1] function for [gapfilling analysis](https://cobrapy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/gapfilling.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "Checking the model's ability to produce the target compound requires a different model objective and additional constraints. The objective of the optimization is set to be the exchange reaction of the target. The biomass reaction has to be constrained in the lower bound, to indicate the model that the optimization of the formation of the target should still allow growth, otherwise the simulation will maximize production leading to 0 1/h growth rate, which is not realistic. Additionally, the uptake of the substrate is constrained by setting a minium lower value that can be indicated by the user if the ammount of substrate in the medium can be estimated. \n",
    "\n",
    "If the consumption of a compound in the medium is the only optimization of interest, an intermediate of the degradation pathway should be indicated anyway in order to be able to use the other functions of the pipeline (including the one needed to score the options). This is due to the fact that the functions downstream to *analysis_gf_sol* build upon the output of this function, hence *dict_prod_sol* uses the output of *analysis_gf_sol* as argument, while the output of both previous function is used by *cons_prod_dict* to generate a final object comprehensive of all the information gathered previously and calls the thermodynamic analysis too. This final output is used among others by *scores_evaluations* to score the several alternative reaction addition and the fluxes of substrate uptake and product formation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this example a model of *Escherichia coli* is used to generate strains able to grow on methane. Formate is indicated as target product as it is an intermediate of methane oxidation pathway.  "
